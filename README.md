# Graph-Search-Algorithms
A program that searches graphs via Depth-first-search, Breadth-first-search, and finds a minimum spanning tree. 

The program reads in a graph from two text files, one containing labels for the graph, one containing the data in the graph.

The program then performs a depth-first-search, breadth-first-search, and then finds a minimum spanning tree for the graph. It prints all results.
